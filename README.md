# pkmnBattleSim
(WIP) A little pokemon battle simulator in C++

The objective is to first create a textual simulator (a bit like Pokemon Showdown), then a graphic one.
I'm working right now on adding new Pok√©mon and attacks. Then I will add abilities and battle objects.

For the moment you have to modify the 'main.cpp' file in './src/' to test the simulator (I will work on an automated version).
